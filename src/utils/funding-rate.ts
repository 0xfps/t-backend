/**
 * Funding rates.
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
 * Note: The math here was solely done by a developer and has not
 * been accepted by the team of devs. It is subject to changes.
 * 
 * Funding rates are calculated from a position's size (margin x leverage)
 * and charged on the position's opening margin. Positions are created
 * with two properties:
 * `openingMargin`: The amount of money the order that opened the position was made with,
 * this is a static property.
 * `fundingRate`: This is a variable property, which at the start is equal to the `openingMargin`,
 * but, as funding rates are charged, the value of this property is incremented or decremented
 * respectively. This value is expected to not fall below a certain treshold, and when that
 * happens, the parent position is liquidated instantly.
 * 
 * Using data from four sources, Bybit, Binance, OKX and Coinbase (future additions), the average
 * spot price for a particular ticker is retrieved and the average is taken. The percentage difference
 * between this average and our last market price is the funding percentage. The funding percentage
 * is used to calculate the funding rate from the position size and charged from or to the position's
 * `fundingRate`. Looking back at it, this is a not-so-good variable name.
 * 
 * @param ticker Ticker.
